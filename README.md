a program allowing us to play a card game derived from Black Jack. The general principle of the game is that the players play alone against the dealer (the bank). A player wins if he totals 21 points. If it exceeds 21 points it loses all the money he bet. Initially, the dealer has a (large) deck of cards made up of several decks of 52 shuffled cards. The value of the cards is as follows: Ace: 1 point, 2: 2 points, etc. 9: 9 points, 10: 10 points, Jack, Queen, King: 10 points.
Progress of a game: Each player initially has a certain amount of money. At the start of the game the players choose how much they want to bet. There is a minimum amount to be allowed to bet (defined at the start of the game by the dealer). The dealer draws a card to each player (visible to everyone). Then in turn, each player performs one of the 3 possible actions: draw card(s), pass their turn, stop. If a player's total reaches exactly 21 points, the player has won and the game ends. The bank pays him 1.5% of his initial investment.
